# cfgfile - Configuration File classes and interfaces
###########################################################

This directory contains interfaces and classes concerned with reading/monitoring
JSON configuration files.

These files can be used to seed RESTConf devices into a given ONOS controller
cluster and is most useful for testing and quick demo purposes.

A real-life 'deployed, application would use the REST interface and/or CLI
too createe and manage the devices.

----------------------------------------------------------
On startup, the suggested sequence of events should be:

1. Restore information from the persistent storage location (may be empty)

2. Read in any configuration file.  Using a unique identifier for each item
   being restored (say MAC address - not decided yet), update any existing
   data (perhaps from step 1) with this data.

   For this purposes, it is suggested that most device information in a
   configuration file be empty for an actual deployment.

3. Register any appropriate device listeners.

   Question: does anyone see a need for RESTConf to hosts at this point?

4. Walk existing topology and look for any new access points interest. While
   some device flows may be controlled by other southbound protocols, RESTConf
   supports more than just flow provisioning.

   During this period, device events may occur.  The fun here will be
   experimenting and figuring out the best thing to do.

5. We are initialized.  Treat device events appropriately.
